        <h2>Transform Your Child’s Bedroom</h2> <br>
        <hr class="blue"><br>
        <p class="one">Fathead is the gift that provides cheer and overwhelming excitement on birthdays or holidays. As it is unwrapped, your child will be
amazed at the vibrant images of their favorite character, superstar athlete or an awe-inspiring animal. The detail captured in a Fathead
will spark your child’s imagination and have them playing along with the Fathead once it is on their wall. As seen in the video, Fathead
causes reactions that have not been witnessed since the Turbo-Man doll.</p>

        <h1>How to Pick the Perfect Fathead</h1><br>
        <hr class="bluee"><br>
        <p class="one">A process so simple that it only requires two steps.</p><br><br><br><br><br>
        <h3>Step 1:</h3><br><br>
        <h4>Choose Your Product Type</h4><br><br>
        <p class="one">There are a variety of Fathead products to choose from - wall decals, Big Heads, Stand Outs, and canvases.</p><br><br>

            <p class="two">Give the customer some concept of what

            <div class="thingy"><img src="images/cam.png" /><br><br><h5>Cutouts</h5><br>
              <hr class="blueee"><br>
            <p class="two">Give the customer some concept of what
              a cutout is, the application types

        <p class="one"><br><br><br>Once you have the space picked out, the installation is a breeze. The majority of Fatheads go up as easy as peel-and-stick. However, there are also
transfer decals (these will have “Rub On Transfer” stated on the product page) that have more intricate designs. Because of their more detailed designs,
transfer wall decals are applied using the transfer method, (read more) instead of a peel-and-stick.</p><br><br><br>

      <br><br><h6>Did You Know?</h6><br>
      <p class="one">In addition to the main wall decal, the majority of Fatheads also come with additional decals. For example, an athlete will come with a name plate and
team logo wall decals and a character will come with other officially licensed artwork.</p><br><br><br>
  <h3>Step 2:</h3><br><br>
  <h4>Choose Your Product Category</h4><br><br>
    <p class="one">Fathead became a household name from the products of life-size athletes but has since extended to hundreds of different product categories. All of our
licensed products are officially licensed, so you get the artwork created by Disney, Nickelodeon, Nintendo, etc., or the team’s official logos for sports
products. You are sure to find a Fathead your child will love!</p><br><br>
