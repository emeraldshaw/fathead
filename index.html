        <p class="one">Fathead is the gift that provides cheer and overwhelming excitement on birthdays or holidays. As it is unwrapped, your child will be
amazed at the vibrant images of their favorite character, superstar athlete or an awe-inspiring animal. The detail captured in a Fathead
will spark your child’s imagination and have them playing along with the Fathead once it is on their wall. As seen in the video, Fathead
causes reactions that have not been witnessed since the Turbo-Man doll.</p>
